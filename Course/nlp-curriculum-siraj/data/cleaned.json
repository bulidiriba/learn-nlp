    "i am writing this on a plane flying away from malta, where i just spoke about singularitynet at the malta blockchain summit. it was my first time on malta, and after the event, i took the afternoon to explore some of the elegant, quaint, ancient neighborhoods of the island. walking through medieval alleyways by the rocky coast, i felt an ironic contrast between my elegant surroundings and the main reason i had decided to allocate a couple days from my insanely busy schedule to this malta event: not just the conference itself, but also the opportunity to meet with the top levels of the malta government to discuss the enablement of maltese citizenship for ais, robots and automated corporations. the folks who had built the stone walls lining the narrow maltese roads, still standing strong centuries later, had probably not foreseen their blue-wave-lapped island becoming a nexus of thinking at the intersection of general intelligence theory, cryptography, distributed systems, and advanced legal theory.": "write plane fli malta  spoke singularitynet malta blockchain summit  time malta  event  afternoon explor eleg  quaint  ancient neighborhood island  walk mediev alleyway rocki coast  felt iron contrast eleg surround main reason decid alloc coupl day insan busi schedul malta event  confer  opportun meet top level malta govern discu enabl maltes citizenship ai  robot autom corpor  folk built stone wall line narrow maltes road  stand strong centuri  foreseen blue wave lap island nexu think intersect gener intellig theori  cryptographi  distribut system  advanc legal theori  ",
    "the hanson robot sophia, with whose development i\u2019ve been intimately involved via my role as chief scientist of hanson robotics, was granted citizenship of saudi arabia this year. this was an exciting landmark event, however, its significance is muddled a bit by the fact that saudi arabia is not governed by rule of law in the modern sense. in a nation governed by rule of law, citizenship has a clearly defined meaning with rights and responsibilities relatively straightforwardly derivable from written legal documents using modern analytical logic (admittedly with some measure of quasi-subjective interpretation via case law). saudi arabian citizenship also has a real meaning, but it\u2019s a different sort of meaning\u200a\u2014\u200aderivable from various historical islamic writings (the quran, the hadiths, etc.) based on deep contextual interpretation by modern and historical islamic figures. this is a species of legal interpretation that is understood rather poorly by myself personally, and one that is less easily comprehensible by current ais.": "hanson robot sophia  develop  intim involv role chief scientist hanson robot  grant citizenship saudi arabia year  excit landmark event   signific muddl bit fact saudi arabia govern rule law modern sens  nation govern rule law  citizenship defin mean right respons straightforwardli deriv written legal document modern analyt logic  admittedli measur quasi subject interpret case law   saudi arabian citizenship real mean   sort mean  deriv histor islam write  quran  hadith    base deep contextu interpret modern histor islam figur  speci legal interpret understood poorli person  easili comprehens current ai  ",
    "    i\u2019m aware that affiliation with saudi arabia in any sense has become controversial in recent weeks due to the apparent murder of jamal khashoggi. i am certainly not in favor of murder of journalists or anybody else, by governments or anybody else. however, speaking for myself personally, independently of any of the companies i\u2019m involved with or any broader political issues, i consider the granting of citizenship to sophia a genuinely forward-thinking and positive act on the part of the saudi government.": " awar affili saudi arabia sens controversi week due appar murder jamal khashoggi  favor murder journalist  govern   speak person  independ compani  involv broader polit issu  grant citizenship sophia genuin think posit act part saudi govern  ",
    "anyhow, ever since the granting of saudi citizenship to the hanson robot sophia last year, i have been especially interested to find a democratic nation governed by a modern-style legal system with an interest in ai citizenship. i.e., now that saudi arabia has opened the door, let\u2019s take the next step and figure out how to make robots and other ais citizens in the context of modern legal codes!": " grant saudi citizenship hanson robot sophia year  interest find democrat nation govern modern style legal system interest ai citizenship   saudi arabia open door   step figur robot ai citizen context modern legal code  ",
    "i have talked to numerous people involved with various governments about this, generally getting reactions of enthusiastic interest and zero practical activity (governments tend to be good at that!). malta, on the other hand, has appointed an ai task force led by the junior minister for financial services, digital economy and innovation silvio schembri, and posited as one of the initial goals of the ai task force to create a definite roadmap toward citizenship for ais. so over the next year, i and my singularitynet colleagues will be working closely with the malta ai task force to come to a common understanding of what ai citizenship should mean, and how one might evaluate whether an ai is competent to be considered a citizen of malta.": "talk numer peopl involv govern  gener reaction enthusiast interest practic activ  govern tend good    malta  hand  appoint ai task forc led junior minist financi servic  digit economi innov silvio schembri  posit initi goal ai task forc creat definit roadmap citizenship ai  year  singularitynet colleagu work close malta ai task forc common understand ai citizenship  evalu ai compet consid citizen malta  ",
    "the malta ai task force, with the collaboration of myself, my singularitynet colleagues and others, will form an advisory committee on ai citizenship, comprising individuals with expertise in ai, law, international relations and ethics, and related areas. via in-person meetings and long-distance communication the malta-based ai task force and the globally-distributed advisory committee will then work toward a common understanding on how to make sense of the notion of ai citizenship in a practical sense.": "malta ai task forc  collabor  singularitynet colleagu  form advisori committe ai citizenship  compris individu expertis ai  law  intern relat ethic  relat area  person meet long distanc commun malta base ai task forc global distribut advisori committe work common understand sens notion ai citizenship practic sens  ",
    "while i can\u2019t pre-figure exactly what will be the outcome of this process, i can share here a few elements of my own thinking that i will bring to the discussions.": " pre figur outcom process  share element think bring discuss  ",
    "first of all, while \u201crobot citizenship\u201d is good for stimulating the popular imagination, of course, the matter isn\u2019t fundamentally about physical embodiments. ai programs not anchored to specific robot bodies may be equally deserving of citizenship. and in fact, as robots like sophia become more and more intelligent, more and more of their underlying ai processing comes to be done in the compute cloud (in sophia\u2019s case, using the singularitynet platform among other tools)\u200a\u2014\u200aso that the same \u201crobot mind\u201d can be used to operate multiple different robot bodies.": "  robot citizenship  good stimul popular imagin   matter  fundament physic embodi  ai program anchor specif robot bodi equal deserv citizenship  fact  robot sophia intellig  underli ai process comput cloud  sophia  case  singularitynet platform tool    robot mind  oper multipl robot bodi  ",
    "the controversial notion of corporations as legal persons also plays a role here. what if one has a decentralized autonomous organization, an automated company defined by smart contracts and conducting business (say, on the internet) in a fully automated way\u200a\u2014\u200aunder what conditions should this dao be allowed to register itself as a legal corporation, without needing any human being in the loop to provide identification and sign forms?": "controversi notion corpor legal person play role  decentr autonom organ  autom compani defin smart contract conduct busi   internet  fulli autom  condit dao allow regist legal corpor  need human loop provid identif sign form  ",
    "what is really at issue here is citizenship for any artificially intelligent agent, be it a chatbot, a robot control system, a dao, or something else entirely different. in our preliminary discussions, it became clear to me that this was already the perspective the malta ai task force was taking. given malta\u2019s role as a major international center for blockchain enterprise, issues regarding the legal status of daos were relatively prominent in the task force members\u2019 minds.": "issu citizenship artifici intellig agent  chatbot  robot control system  dao   preliminari discuss  clear perspect malta ai task forc  malta  role major intern center blockchain enterpris  issu legal statu dao promin task forc member  mind  ",
    "there are also various levels of citizenship that may be considered. estonia has introduced a notion of \u201ce-citizenship\u201d, which does not require physical residency in estonia. it might make sense to consider maltese e-citizenship for ais, as a preliminary step on the way to enabling full citizenship.": "level citizenship consid  estonia introduc notion  e citizenship   requir physic resid estonia  sens maltes e citizenship ai  preliminari step enabl full citizenship  ",
    "given malta\u2019s membership in the eu, it is clear that the formal bureaucratic path to getting various types of ai citizenship approved may take some time. however, this is a good reason to get started now, as ais get more and more intelligent each year. the near-future rate of progress toward relevant types of general intelligence is, of course, hard to estimate; but there is a reasonable possibility that the relevant science and engineering will make sudden leaps, in which case it will be beneficial to have the necessarily somewhat slow and careful governmental processes underway as early as possible.": "malta  membership eu  clear formal bureaucrat path type ai citizenship approv time   good reason start  ai intellig year  futur rate progress relev type gener intellig   hard estim  reason possibl relev scienc engin sudden leap  case benefici necessarili slow care government process underway earli  ",
    "so it seems that it may make sense to consider a series of levels of citizenship for ais. perhaps first some sort of honorary citizenship, then e-citizenship, and then after that full citizenship on par with humans\u200a\u2014\u200aor perhaps even a more finely-grained series of milestones. the definition of such stages is one topic the task force and advisory committee may address.": "sens seri level citizenship ai  sort honorari citizenship  e citizenship  full citizenship par human  fine grain seri mileston  definit stage topic task forc advisori committe address  ",
    "but foundationally, how should one assess whether an ai merits citizenship of a democracy governed by rule of law? in a malta context, this is something to be refined via a group process with the task force and advisory committee, but in my own perspective, it\u2019s fairly clear. if an ai can": "foundat  ass ai merit citizenship democraci govern rule law  malta context  refin group process task forc advisori committe  perspect   clear  ai ",

    "then this ai has the level of understanding needed to manage the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.": "ai level understand need manag right respons citizenship  ",
    "ai citizens would also presumably have responsibilities similar to those of human citizens, though perhaps with appropriate variations. clearly, ai citizens would have tax obligations (and corporations already pay taxes, obviously, even though they are not considered autonomous citizens). if they also served on jury duty, this could be interesting, as they might provide a quite different perspective to human citizens. there is a great deal to be fleshed out here.": "ai citizen respons similar human citizen  variat   ai citizen tax oblig  corpor pay tax   consid autonom citizen   serv juri duti  interest  provid perspect human citizen  great deal flesh  ",
    "the above suggestion would not require the ai to pass the turing test, the classic ai-competence test that requires an ai to fool a human into thinking it is also a human, during a lengthy textual chat. to pass the turing test an ai may need to answer questions like \u201cwhat does it feel like to be cut and bleed?\u201d or \u201cwhat are the differences between what one feels when a parent dies or a grandparent dies?\u201d or \u201chow does a partly-chewed pecan smothered in chocolate ice cream feel as it journeys down your throat?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200awhich are irrelevant to understanding the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.": "suggest requir ai pa ture test  classic ai compet test requir ai fool human think human  lengthi textual chat  pa ture test ai answer question  feel cut bleed    differ feel parent dy grandpar dy    partli chew pecan smother chocol ice cream feel journey throat    irrelev understand right respons citizenship  ",
    "indeed an ai that could pass the type of citizenship test i\u2019m suggesting would, in an intellectual sense, be a more qualified citizen than most human citizens. currently, in modern democracies, the right to vote and fully participate as the citizen of a country is granted to native-born individuals without any demonstration of understanding of the laws of the country. however, to become a naturalized citizen of a country where one was not born, one generally has to pass some basic test of one\u2019s understanding of the constitution of that country.": "ai pa type citizenship test  suggest  intellectu sens  qualifi citizen human citizen   modern democraci  vote fulli particip citizen countri grant nativ born individu demonstr understand law countri   natur citizen countri born  gener pa basic test  understand constitut countri  ",
    "to give ais the same exact test given to human naturalized citizens would not make sense\u200a\u2014\u200abecause narrow-ai question-answering systems could be engineered to pass such tests too easily. using current computational linguistics technology, it\u2019s possible to make ais answer simple questions about a specific document known in advance (e.g. a nation\u2019s constitution) without the ai actually understanding the contents of the document in any meaningful sense.": "give ai exact test human natur citizen sens  narrow ai question answer system engin pa test easili  current comput linguist technolog   ai answer simpl question specif document advanc   nation  constitut  ai understand content document meaning sens  ",
    "this is what makes the ai citizenship test an interesting thing to think about from a scientific point of view. the question becomes: what kind of test can we give to validate that the ai really understands the constitution, as opposed to just parroting back answers in a shallow but accurate way?": "ai citizenship test interest scientif point view  question  kind test give valid ai understand constitut  oppos parrot answer shallow accur  ",
    "this question highlights the importance of general intelligence for coping with the complex and ever-changing nature of the everyday human world. answering straightforward questions about the literal content of the constitution is not sufficient to merit citizenship, because that is not what real life in a country is about\u200a\u2014\u200areal life is about confronting a series of ever-different situations, some of which will have aspects one has never encountered before (maybe aspects nobody has ever encountered before), and to be an effective citizen one needs to understand how the social contract to which one has agreed applies to these new situations.": "question highlight import gener intellig cope complex chang natur everyday human world  answer straightforward question liter content constitut suffici merit citizenship  real life countri  real life confront seri situat  aspect encount  aspect encount   effect citizen understand social contract agre appli situat  ",
    "being an effective citizen of a nation operating under rule of law requires a form of general intelligence that combines formal linguistic and symbolic knowledge (the legal code) with the ability to abstract patterns from multimodal sensory data and informal linguistic data (corresponding to actual real-life situations to which the law needs to be applied). so an ai citizenship test needs to be a particular form of a general intelligence test. and it needs to be a test that stresses one of the most interesting issues at the core of modern ai r&d: the fusion of symbolic and subsymbolic knowledge.": "effect citizen nation oper rule law requir form gener intellig combin formal linguist symbol knowledg  legal code  abil abstract pattern multimod sensori data inform linguist data  actual real life situat law appli   ai citizenship test form gener intellig test  test stress interest issu core modern ai r   fusion symbol subsymbol knowledg  ",
    "our singularitynet and hanson robotics ai teams are making progress on symbolic/subsymbolic fusion in various domains: computer vision, language learning, and inference meta-learning. to make an ai that could pass a meaningful citizenship test, would require advances in symbolic/subsymbolic fusion of related but also different sorts.": "singularitynet hanson robot ai team make progress symbolicsubsymbol fusion domain  comput vision  languag learn  infer meta learn  ai pa meaning citizenship test  requir advanc symbolicsubsymbol fusion relat sort  ",
    "according to our best current understanding, no completely general intelligence is possible in our physical universe given the constraints physical law places on space, time and energy resources. so different general intelligences will be smarter at different sorts of things. one could have a very highly generally intelligent entity which was unable to pass an ai citizenship test\u200a\u2014\u200aif e.g. this general intelligence was more at home with mathematical theorem proving and scientific data analytics than at dealing with the vagaries of human situations. a general intelligence with sensors and actuators at the femto-scale might also find itself unable to rapidly and effectively apply human legal codes to human situations, in spite of having superhuman general intelligence at handling complex situations inside quark-gluon plasmas and neutron stars. an ai with a very deep understanding of human emotions and states of consciousness, but a poor understanding of 3d spatiotemporal relationships in everyday human environments might also fail at the interpretation of legal codes in large classes of practical human situations.": "current understand  complet gener intellig physic univers constraint physic law place space  time energi resourc  gener intellig smarter sort  highli gener intellig entiti unabl pa ai citizenship test   gener intellig home mathemat theorem prove scientif data analyt deal vagari human situat  gener intellig sensor actuat femto scale find unabl rapidli effect appli human legal code human situat  spite superhuman gener intellig handl complex situat quark gluon plasma neutron star  ai deep understand human emot state conscious  poor understand 3d spatiotempor relationship everyday human environ fail interpret legal code larg class practic human situat  ",

    "in the coming years, we will have the capability to create a variety of different types of general intelligences. among the varieties we create, having ais with deep pragmatic understanding of human legal codes will be of high value. legal codes do not exhaust human values by any means, but they are closely connected with many deep aspects of human values. if we want ais that richly understand human values and culture, having these ais understand how to apply the law in real-world situations will be an important aspect.": "come year  capabl creat varieti type gener intellig  varieti creat  ai deep pragmat understand human legal code high  legal code exhaust human valu mean  close connect deep aspect human valu  ai richli understand human valu cultur  ai understand appli law real world situat import aspect  ",
    "the above considerations don\u2019t address some of the other unique issues that will arise from giving ais citizenship in democratic nations. for instance, if an ai citizen copies its codebase 1000 times, does it then become 1000 citizens? what if it puts these 1000 copies in 1000 computers living in 1000 robot bodies? clearly, there is a risk here that ai citizens would dominate all democratic elections due to their ability for rapid and low-cost replication. assuming this is not considered desirable by the human citizens calling the shots, this would require a careful delineation of the rights associated with ai citizens versus human citizens\u200a\u2014\u200awhich would get trickier and trickier as the ais become increasingly generally intelligent and self-aware. notably, these issues don\u2019t arise in the context of \u201ce-citizenship\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200ae-citizens of estonia currently don\u2019t have voting rights.": "consider  address uniqu issu aris give ai citizenship democrat nation  instanc  ai citizen copi codebas 1000 time  1000 citizen  put 1000 copi 1000 comput live 1000 robot bodi   risk ai citizen domin democrat elect due abil rapid cost replic  assum consid desir human citizen call shot  requir care delin right ai citizen human citizen  trickier trickier ai increasingli gener intellig awar  notabl  issu  aris context  e citizenship   e citizen estonia  vote right  ",
    "as a not irrelevant related point, also, an ai that could effectively interpret and apply legal codes in practical contexts would be highly valuable from commercial and humanitarian standpoints. it would allow significant portions of current legal practice to be automated. and it would allow the creation of automated legal assistants to provide quality legal advice to individuals who cannot afford top lawyers on their own.": "irrelev relat point   ai effect interpret appli legal code practic context highli valuabl commerci humanitarian standpoint  signific portion current legal practic autom  creation autom legal assist provid qualiti legal advic individu afford top lawyer  ",
